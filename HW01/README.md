# Homework1 / Linear Binary Perceptron

## Overview
<p>The homework consists of two parts: 1) Implement a perceptron which is able to tell data with positive labels from those with negative labels; and 2) Calculate the weights, which can be simply regarded as correlation, between students features (namely gender, activities, tests, and participation) in a course and final consequences (pass or fail) of them.</p>
<p>In the first part, a matlab script <code>Hw1_LinBinPerc_DataGen.m</code> is needed to generate a random set of data with binary labels so that the data are known to be linearly separable. Then, the task is to pretend that the linear weight are unknown and train the perceptron with some algorithm iteratively.</p>
<p>In the second part, there is a given excel file <code>NN_RealDataForHW1.csv</code> that contains grade information from a real NTHU course (obfuscated to hide the identity of students). Each column contains the grades for an activity, and the task is to discover how these columns were linearly combined to determine whether a student hass passed(P) or failed(F). The code developed for the frist part can be used in this part, and the final weights and bias in the trained perceptron should be shown in the report.</p>
<p>Note: For the second part, the following MATLAB functions may be useful: <code>csvread()</code>, <code>importdata()</code>.</p>
